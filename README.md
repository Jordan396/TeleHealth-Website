# TeleHealth_Website_Version1

This webpage was designed as part of a school project to raise awareness about the various “Smart Nation” initiatives in Singapore. Among the myriad of initiatives available, I have chosen TeleHealth as I believe that while it promises much potential, it is something that is still relatively unheard of today.

This webpage was designed using <b>HTML5</b> and <b>CSS</b>. The text editor Brackets really came in handy with its Live Preview feature too!

Credits to <b>Jonas Schmedtmann</b> and his Omnifood website, which served as an inspiration for me and it was from which I adapted to create this webpage. If you’re keen on website design as well, I’d recommend checking out his courses on Udemy as that’s where I picked up my skills for this webpage.
