# TeleHealth_Website_Version1

### Project Background
This website was designed as part of a school project to raise awareness about the various “Smart Nation” initiatives in Singapore. I have chosen TeleHealth as I believe that while it promises much potential, it is something that is still relatively unheard of today.

This website was designed using <b>HTML5</b> and <b>CSS</b>. The text editor <b>Brackets</b> really came in handy with its <i>Live Preview</i> feature!

Credits to <b>Jonas Schmedtmann</b> and his <i>Omnifood</i> website, which served as an inspiration for me and it was from which I adapted to create this webpage. If you’re keen on website design as well, I’d recommend checking out his courses on Udemy as that’s where I picked up my skills for this website.

### Viewing the Website
1) Clone this repository.
2) Download <b>Brackets</b> via this link: http://brackets.io/
3) Open the <i>index.html</i> file using brackets.
4) Click on "Live Preview" at the top right corner of the Brackets application.

Hope you learnt a little something from my simple website design!
